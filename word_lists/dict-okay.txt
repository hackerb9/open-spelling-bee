laudanum			# Tincture of opium. [a. mod.L. laudanum, used by Paracelsus as the name of a medicament for which he gives a pretended prescription, the ingredients comprising leaf-gold, pearls not perforated, etc. (Opera 1658 I. 492/2). It was early suspected that opium was the real agent of the cures which Paracelsus professed to have effected by this costly means; hence the name was applied to certain opiate preparations which were sold as identical with his famous remedy.  It is doubtful whether the word as used by Paracelsus was a fanciful application of laudanum a med.L. variant of ladanum, or was suggested by laudāre to praise or by some other word, or was formed quite arbitrarily.]  “The Laudanum of rhetoric, whose property will occasionally benumb..the power of common understandings.”

Probably an echo of the F. imperative parez! as a word of command, constantly used in giving fencing lessons.]  “Good fencers push and parry at the same time... The Spaniards parry with the poniard. The ancients parried with their bucklers.”
