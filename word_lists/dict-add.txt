# Words that are common enough that they ought to be used to create
# puzzles even though they aren't listed in SCOWL's top 35% of English.
# See also: scowl/english-words.35

# Note: adding a word with seven different letters may prevent any
# puzzles from being created with those letters. For example,
# english-words.35 already has CUNNINGLY which can be used as a
# pangram to create puzzles. If we added UNICYCLING, there would be
# two possible solutions, so generate_puzzles.py would reject both.
