# Words that are common enough that they ought to be used to create
# puzzles even though they aren't listed in SCOWL's top 35% of English.
# See also: scowl/english-words.35

# Note 1: Be careful editing this file. If a word is added, it is
# important to allow exactly the _common_ forms of a word, no more, no
# less. If some common forms are allowed and not others the player
# will be annoyed by the inconsistency. If too many inflections are
# accepted, players will be annoyed that the required words contain
# obscure forms. ("alfalfa", yes; "alfalfas", no. "burpee", no;
# "burpees", yes). If you're not sure, you can always put the word in
# dict-okay.txt

# Note 2: Adding a word with seven different letters may prevent any
# puzzles from being created with those letters. For example,
# english-words.35 already has CUNNINGLY which can be used as a
# pangram to create puzzles. If we added UNICYCLING, there would be
# two possible solutions, so generate_puzzles.py would reject both.
