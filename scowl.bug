1. VERBING PROBLEM

The SCOWL wordlist seems to have a VERBING PROBLEM. There are a bunch
of words such as "GEED" and "GEEING" listed as "common" when only the
non-verb form of the root word ("GEE") is actually common. This causes
puzzles to be created with much more difficult words than intended.

For example, the file 'english-words.35' contains the following:

    gangled, gangling
    gangrened, gangrening
    garaged, garaging
    garlanded, garlanding
    garrisoning
    gating
    gazetted, gazetting
    geed, geeing
    gentled, gentling
    ghosted, ghosting
    gifting
    ginned, ginning
    gladdened, gladdening
    glamoured, glamouring
    glassed, glassing
    gloried, glorying
    gloving
    gnarls, gnarling
    gobbed, gobbing
    grassed, grassing
    greened, greening
    grimed, griming
    guested, guesting
    gulled, gulling
    gusted, gusting
    guttered, guttering
    guyed, guying

(The problem occurs with all letters, but only 'G*ING' was checked by
hand. For example: husbanded, husbanding, hyphened, hyphening,
impoverishes, impoverishing, ingrains, ingraining, instanced,
instancing, interluded, interluding)

While the above are all wonderful and valid words in English, they
should be bonus words, not required to solve the puzzle 100%.

This is a bug in SCOWL. Each filename that ends in a number ".n"
should only have words in it which are in the top n% of usage. The
words above, from 'english-words.35', are a problem because they are
so rare that it is unlikely thaty are from the top 35%.

2. ACADEMIC CORPUS

The file english-words.10 seems to not suffer from the verbing
problem. However, it has another issue: it appears to be derived from
an ACADEMIC CORPUS. It contains many words — such as "CS", "cumming",
"pi", "re", and "sophisticating" — that are almost certainly not in
the top 10% of English usage.

The corpus used for SCOWL appears to be email and papers from some
academic institution. Here are some of the words in the "top 10%"
which give it away:

  "absence", "academic", "accordingly", "administration", "admittedly",
  "algorithm", "ambiguous", "analogue", "analysis", "arbitrary",
  "beforehand", "buffer", "bytes", "calculations", "chairman", "computing",
  "database", "datum", "datum's", "decision's", "department", "discipline",
  "distribution", "documentation", "engineering", "forthcoming", "graduate",
  "hardware", "hyphenation", "hypothetheses" "indefinable", "implementing",
  "inputing", "institution", "introduction", "invariably", "justification",
  "keyboard", "laboratory", "lessons", "liable", "literature", "logging",
  "magnitude", "manipulation", "mathematical", "mechanism", "membership",
  "misleading", "mod", "nevertheless", "numerical", "obviously", "papers",
  "paragraph", "parallel", "particularly", "phenomenon", "philosophy",
  "postmaster", "printout", "procedure", "processors", "programmed",
  "proposed", "publication", "qualifying", "readily", "references",
  "referred", "requirements", "respectively", "scientific", "simultaneously",
  "software", "specifying", "straightforward", "submitting", "terminology",
  "theoretical", "thereby", "therefore", "thus", "undergraduate", "users",
  "whatsoever", "whereas", "widespread"

The file english-words.20 seems to be similar: it does not have the
verbing problem, but does seem to over emphasize the acadmic domain.
